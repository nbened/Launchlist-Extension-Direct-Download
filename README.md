# Welcome, Favorite Beta Tester
Here's how you install the extension directly

### Steps
1. Download the dist.zip
2. Extract the dist.zip on your machine
3. Type in 'chrome://extensions' in the search bar.
4. Enable 'Developer mode' in the top right toggle.
5. Click 'Load Unpacked' in the top left and select your unzipped folder
6. Press the reset button so the service worker is not inactive ("errors" are totally fine)
7. Return to Launchlist

Now directory votes can be verified and you can stay up to date from Twitter.

Launchlist will only stop showing the extension reminder when you complete step 7.
